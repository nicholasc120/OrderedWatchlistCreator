            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>
                So when I first got Disney+ I wanted to rewatch all the sitcoms I watched growing up, starting with
                but
                not limited to <i>That's So Raven</i>, <i>The Suite Life of Zack and Cody</i>, <i>Hannah
                    Montana</i>,
                and <i>Wizards of Waverly Place</i>. I started watching those shows in rotation, one after the
                other,
                but the problem is that none of these shows started airing at the same time. So when the <i>That's
                    so
                    Suite Life of Hannah Montana</i> crossover episode happened, it happened out of sync. Completely
                killed my immersion. In addition, Season 4 of <i>Good Luck Charlie</i> starts off with Amy pregnant
                again, and I was all like, "when did this happen??" because I didn't have the Disney Channel
                original
                movies in the rotation as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                So eventually I wanted to try it all again and wanted to create a watchlist that included all the
                shows
                I care about and every Disney Channel original movie that aired during that time. I copied the original
                airdates of every original movie and show that aired on Disney Channel from random tables on the
                internet and compiled it all into a spreadsheet. Then, I picked out the shows and movies I cared
                about (so everything except <i>Sonny With a Chance</i>) and sorted them by their original airdate. It
                took about an hour, but it was worth it to accurately experience the decade of TV I was familiar with.
                It was the <b>definitive</b> way to enjoy all of these shows.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I realized that this idea could be extended and automated for <i>any</i> show, not just for the
                ones on Disney Channel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowverse">Arrowverse</a>, spanning over 6
                different shows that aired simultaneously for over a decade, crossing over with three
                shows set in a different universe. If you watched all these
                shows without knowing the order they aired in, it would be a nightmare. With this app, it will
                figure
                out the order for you, and you can download a spreadsheet to track what you have and haven't seen
                yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Or what if you wanted to watch all of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1321658/">Michael
                    Shur's</a>
                sitcoms? Could you imagine the tonal whiplash between Season 1 of <i>The Office</i> and Season 1 of
                <i>The Good Place</i>? <i>The Office</i> started airing in 2005, and <i>The Good Place</i> started
                in
                2016. Despite both premiering on NBC, the landscape of network television had changed completely
                between
                those two shows. You need to watch these shows in the right order to see the gradual transition over
                time. Honestly it kind of bothers me how most people don't get that. Do you want to know why revivals
                like <i>iCarly</i>, or <i>Girl Meets World</i>, or <i>How I Met Your Father</i> are so bad?? It's
                because the TV landscape has shifted drastically from when the original shows aired. They're still using
                90's writing in 2020 do you see the problem? And there isn't anything <i>wrong</i> with the multi-camera
                studio audience sitcom, it was obviously the most natural transition from stage to TV (hence the term
                "teleplay"), but the problem is that viewers have been spoiled by the single-camera format. And I can
                enjoy these shows but even I have to admit, even the most recent ones like <i>The Neighborhood</i> seem
                dated, despite the fact that it's still airing. See if you ask me, the late 2000's was the rise of
                single-camera sitcoms on NBC, and I often say it's one of the best era's of TV, despite it not counting
                as the "golden era" (which was also really good). Shows like
                <i>Community</i>, <i>The Office</i>, <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, <i>30 Rock</i>. And with that change
                the multi-camera studio audience format began to die out. Sure, you still had high-performing shows like
                <i>Two and a Half Men</i>, <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, and <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>, but this is
                really when people started to complain about this format. Yeah the laugh track is kind of distracting
                (except in <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>, cause unlike Chuck Lorre's sitcoms, they don't wait for
                laughter and instead dub over the laughter in post so it's less noticeable), but considering that it's a
                <b>teleplay</b> it makes sense. It's a stage play that's simply being put on film. 2009 was actually the
                last year a multi-camera studio audience sitcom (<i>How I Met Your Mother</i>) other than <i>The Big
                    Bang Theory</i> was nominated for an Emmy in Outstanding Comedy Series. I mean if you look at years
                before and up to 2005, before the popularization of single-camera sitcoms, these categories are mostly
                dominated with shows like <i>Everybody Loves Raymond</i>, <i>Friends</i>, <i>Will and Grace</i>. After
                that, audiences just seemed to lose interest, save for the shows created by Chuck Lorre. Which is a
                whole other thing entirely, like I always felt like most of Chuck Lorre's sitcoms often failed to have a
                satisfying denouement. There's no real satisfying third act, ya know? My point is, the rise of
                single-camera sitcoms on NBC in the late 2000's irreparably changed the course of television, for better
                and for worse, meaning that there is a legitimate noticeable change between different eras of
                television.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh plus, if you throw in <i>New Girl</i>, you get to see the crossovers between it and
                <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even procedurals like <i>9-1-1</i> and <i>9-1-1 Lone Star</i>, or <i>NCIS:LA</i> and <i>Hawaii
                    Five-O</i> are greatly enhanced when watched in the right order. Network television was meant to be
                syndicated, not binged. Online streaming services like Netflix that are built around binging multiple
                episodes of a single show are broken that way. Honestly they've kind of ruined the way viewers watch TV.
                Do you know why seasons are 10 episodes long now? or why every episode has to end on a cliffhanger?
                Because Netflix started the whole "bingeable" format of TV, which is honestly kind of awful. They're not
                writing episodes now, they're writing 10-hour long movies that they just split up. And it makes it
                worse. Forgive me for thinking an "episode" should be "episodic". I'm not saying shows should never be
                serialized, but not every show needs to be <i>Lost</i> (and thank god it's not. Remember the ending??).
                Instead of each episode having its own pacing, the entire series has a pacing that needs to be followed,
                which means if you don't watch the whole thing all at once, it screws it up. At that point, it's not
                even a show anymore, it's a <b>10-hour long movie</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's like Abed says in the series finale of <i>Community</i>:
            <blockquote cite="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3898640/characters/nm2209821">
                There is skill to it. More importantly, it has to be joyful, effortless, fun. TV defeats its own purpose
                when it's pushing an agenda, or trying to defeat other TV or being proud or ashamed of itself for
                existing. It's TV, it's comfort. It's a friend you've known so well, and for so long you just let it be
                with you. And it needs to be okay for it to have a bad day, or phone in a day. And it needs to be okay
                for it to get on a boat with Levar Burton and never come back. Because eventually, it all will.
            </blockquote>
